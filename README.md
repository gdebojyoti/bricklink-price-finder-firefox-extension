# BrickLink Price Finder 🧱💰🔍
###### A browser extension for Mozilla Firefox 🦊

This is my first attempt at creating a browser extension. Its purpose is to let you automate the process of going through multiple BrickLink product URLs and fetching the best price of each item. 😍

I honestly have no idea whether such an extension already exists. May be it does.. 😬

But hey - I really wanted to build a browser extension, and I could not think of a better way to get started. 🤪

This extension will work on Mozilla Firefox (Firefox FTW! 🤘🏼). I am not sure whether I will (read: "want to") build one for Chrome in the future. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Cheers! 🍻

**DISCLAIMER: THIS EXTENSION IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS** ⚒️
